Once upon a time,
a shepherd boy tended
his master’s sheep near
a dark forest not far
from the village. Soon
he found his days in the
pasture very dull.
“There is no one to
talk with, and there is
nothing to do!” he would
moan. All he could do
was talk to his dog or
play on his shepherd’s
pipe.

One day as he sat
watching the sheep
and the quiet forest,
he thought of a plan to
amuse himself.
His master had told
him to call for help if a
wolf should attack the
flock, and the villagers
would come running to
drive it away. If I alert
the village that a wolf is
here, people will come.
Then I’ll have lots of
people to talk to, and
what fun it will be! the
shepherd boy thought.
